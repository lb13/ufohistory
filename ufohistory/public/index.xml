      <description>The newly formed 4602nd Air Intelligence Squadron (AISS) of the Air Defense Command was assigned the task of investigating only the most important UFO cases with intelligence or national security implications. These cases were deliberately siphoned away from Blue Book, leaving Blue Book to deal with the more trivial reports.</description>

      <description>The Condon Committee suggested that there was nothing extraordinary about UFOs, and while it left a minority of cases unexplained, the report also argued that further research would not be likely to yield significant results.

      <description>Initially led by Captain Edward J. Ruppelt.
He commissioned the Battelle Memorial Institute to create the questionnaire and computerize the data. Using case reports and the computerized data, Battelle then conducted a massive scientific and statistical study of all Air Force UFO cases, completed in 1954 and known as &amp;ldquo;Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14&amp;rdquo;
Starting in late March 1952, the Institute started analyzing existing sighting reports and encoding about 30 report characteristics onto IBM punched cards for computer analysis.</description>

      <description>As an immediate consequence of the Robertson Panel recommendations, in February 1953, the Air Force issued Regulation 200-2, ordering air base officers to publicly discuss UFO incidents only if they were judged to have been solved, and to classify all the unsolved cases to keep them out of the public eye</description>

      <description>1953-January-14,15,16 Robertson Panel, Washington D.C. CIA-sponsored meeting of a scientific panel to consider the problem of &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo;.
The outcome of these meetings was a classified recommendation to make up stories and plausible explanations for the phenomenon to keep the public unaware of extra terrestrials and reduce the number of UFO reports coming in.
It concluded that it should discount all reports from the public and rely on instrumentation from the military.</description>

      <description>Recovered materials were sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and from there went to Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI) where they led to the development of memory materials using titanium alloys.
Tom Delonge believes that the craft was German/Argentinian.
Debris was analysed by Elroy John Center at BMI, said that the debris had been inscribed with strange symbols that he called &amp;ldquo;glyphics&amp;rdquo;.
