                          In late December 1951, Ruppelt met with members of the Battelle Memorial Institute, a think tank based in Columbus, Ohio. Ruppelt wanted their experts to assist them in making the Air Force UFO study more scientific. It was the Battelle Institute that devised the standardized reporting form.

                          President Eisenhower allegedly meets with extraterrestrials at Holloman Airforce Base and signs a treaty with Grey aliens that states the aliens would not interfere in human affairs, and humans would not interfere in theirs; the US Government would keep their presence on earth secret while the aliens would furnish the US with advanced technology. In addition, the aliens could abduct humans and livestock on a limited basis for medical examination and monitoring - the people subjected to these experiences would not be harmed, and would be returned to their point of abduction with no recollection of the event. The US could also do a medical examination and genetic experience with aliens and would share the results; the aliens would be granted secret facilities for their accommodations and experiences. According to Bob Lazar this exchange continued in central Nevada until 1979 &#39;...at which time there was a conflict which brought the program to an abrupt halt&#39;.

                          President Dwight Eisenhower established a permanent committee to oversee and conduct all covert activities with the aliens by the Greada Treaty. This committee, created on secrecy by Executive Memorandum, NSC5410, is known as “Majority Twelve” or simple as MJ12. In later years this operation evolved into and became known as MAJI (the Majority Agency for Joint Intelligence).

                          According to Bob Lazar this exchange continued in central Nevada until 1979 &#39;...at which time there was a conflict which brought the program to an abrupt halt&#39;, with an agreement that the Greys would return at some point in the future. The US government attempted to reverse engineer the remaining hardware using the information they had so-far obtained.

                          According to Bob Lazar, scientists experimenting on one of the UFOs held by the US government attempted to cut into its reactor, triggering a release of antimatter and killing the researchers. The explosion was explained as an unannounced low-yield underground nuke test.
