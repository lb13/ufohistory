                            <strong>A letter to the Commanding General of the (then) Army Air Forces stated that UFOs are real and may fall into a number of categories, but that a dedicated effort was required to investigate and understand them - this served as the impetuous for Project Sign.</strong>

<p>In his book <em><a href="/sources/report-on-ufos-ruppelt">The Report on UFOs</a></em>, Edward Ruppelt provides the following account:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On September 23, 1947, the chief of the Air Technical Intelligence Center, one of the Air Force&rsquo;s most highly specialized intelligence units, sent a letter to the Commanding General of the then Army Air Forces.</p>
<p>The letter was in answer to the Commanding General&rsquo;s verbal request to make a preliminary study of the reports of unidentified flying objects. The letter said that after a preliminary study of UFO reports, ATIC concluded that, to quote from the letter, &ldquo;the reported phenomena were real.&rdquo; The letter strongly urged that a permanent project be established at ATIC to investigate and analyze future UFO reports. It requested a priority for the project, a registered code name, and an over-all security classification. ATICs request was granted and Project Sign, the forerunner of Project Grudge and Project Blue Book, was launched. It was given a 2A priority, 1A being the highest priority an Air Force project could have.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>ATICs intelligence specialists were confident that within a few months or a year they would have the answer to the question, &ldquo;What are UFO&rsquo;s?&rdquo; The question, &ldquo;Do UFO&rsquo;s exist?&rdquo; was never mentioned. The only problem that confronted the people at ATIC was, &ldquo;Were the UFO&rsquo;s of Russian or interplanetary origin?&rdquo; Either case called for a serious, secrecy-shrouded project. Only top people at ATIC were assigned to Project Sign.</p>
