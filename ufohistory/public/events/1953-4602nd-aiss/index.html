        <h1>4602nd AISS</h1>

        <p><p>The newly formed 4602nd Air Intelligence Squadron (AISS) of the Air Defense Command was assigned the task of investigating only the most important UFO cases with intelligence or national security implications. These cases were deliberately siphoned away from Blue Book, leaving Blue Book to deal with the more trivial reports.</p>
