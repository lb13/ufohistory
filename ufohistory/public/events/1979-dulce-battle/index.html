<p>While involved in building an addition to the deep underground military facility at Dulce, New Mexico, an incident occurred quite by accident.</p>
<p>The Dulce base, allegedly, is the most profound military service, over 2.5 miles deep, with seven levels, with labs, door rooms, a railroad connection to Los Alamos and a spacecraft’s entrance.</p>
<p>According to Philip Schneider, his team drilled four distinct holes in the desert with the intention to connect each other.</p>
<p>Then he dropped to the end of the holes and analyzed rock samples, to them recommend the quantities and type of explosives.</p>
<p>At one of this drops, the group was surrounded by outer-space aliens, otherwise known as large Greys to an enormous cavern.</p>
<p>In Schneider’s own words:
“I shot two of them. At that time, there were 30 people down there. About 40 more came down after this started, and all of them got killed. We had surprised a whole underground base of existing aliens. Later, we found out that they had been living on our planet for a long time, perhaps a million years. This could explain a lot of what is behind the theory of ancient astronauts.”</p>
<p>During the bout, a tall Grey made a kind of movement with his “hand” on his chest (as if he made waves over his chest) and a blue ray struck Philip’s rib cage, knocking him to the ground.</p>
<p>Besides his chest, the lighting cut off and burned several fingers and nails of his hand and foot.</p>
<p>Sixty-six humans lost their lives in this battle, only Philip and other two men managed to escape.</p>
<p>For over a year Philip received treatment in a radiation isolation therapy.</p>
