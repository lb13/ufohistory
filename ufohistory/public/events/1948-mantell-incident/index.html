                <p>In his book <em><a href="/sources/report-on-ufos-ruppelt">The Report on UFOs</a></em>, Edward Ruppelt provides the following account:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On January 7 all of the late papers in the U.S. carried headlines similar to those in the Louisville Courier: &ldquo;F-51 and Capt. Mantell Destroyed Chasing Flying Saucer.&rdquo; This was Volume I of &ldquo;The
Classics,&rdquo; the Mantell Incident.</p>
<p>At one-fifteen on that afternoon the control tower operators at Godman AFB, outside Louisville, Kentucky, received a telephone call from the Kentucky State Highway Patrol. The patrol wanted to know if Godman Tower knew anything about any unusual aircraft in the vicinity. Several people from Maysville, Kentucky, a small town 80 miles east of Louisville, had reported seeing a strange aircraft. Godman knew that they had nothing in the vicinity so they called Flight Service at Wright-Patterson AFB. In a few minutes Flight Service called back. Their air Traffic control board showed no flights in the area. About twenty minutes later the state police called again. This time people from the towns of Owensboro and Irvington, Kentucky, west of Louisville, were reporting a strange craft. The report from these two towns was a little more complete. The townspeople had described the object to the state police as being &ldquo;circular, about 250 to 300 feet in diameter,&rdquo; and moving westward at a &ldquo;pretty good clip.&rdquo; Godman Tower checked Flight Service again. Nothing. All this time the tower operators had been looking for the reported object. They theorized that since the UFO had had to pass north of Godman to get from Maysville to Owensboro it might come back.</p>
<p>At one forty-five they saw it, or something like it. Later, in his official report, the assistant tower operator said that he had seen the object for several minutes before he called his chiefs attention to it. He said that he had been reluctant to &ldquo;make a flying saucer report.&rdquo; As soon as the two men in the tower had assured themselves that the UFO they saw was not an airplane or a weather balloon, they called Flight Operations. They wanted the operations officer to see the UFO. Before long word of the sighting had gotten around to key personnel on the base, and several officers, besides the base operations officer and the base intelligence officer, were in the tower. All of them looked at the UFO through the tower&rsquo;s 6 x 50 binoculars and decided they couldn&rsquo;t identify it. About this time Colonel Hix, the base commander, arrived. He looked and he was baffled. At two-thirty, they reported, they were discussing what should be done when four F-51&rsquo;s came into view, approaching the base from the south.</p>
<p>The tower called the flight leader, Captain Mantell, and asked him to take a look at the object and try to identify it. One F-51 in the flight was running low on fuel, so he asked permission to go on to his base. Mantell took his two remaining wing men, made a turn, and started after the UFO. The people in Godman Tower were directing him as none of the pilots could see the object at this time. They gave Mantell an initial heading toward the south and the flight was last seen heading in the general direction of the UFO.</p>
<p>By the time the F-51&rsquo;s had climbed to 10,000 feet, the two wing men later reported, Mantell had pulled out ahead of them and they could just barely see him. At two forty-five Mantell called the tower and said, &ldquo;I see something above and ahead of me and I&rsquo;m still climbing.&rdquo; All the people in the tower heard Mantell say this and they heard one of the wing men call back and ask, &ldquo;What the hell are we looking for?&rdquo; The tower immediately called Mantell and asked him for a description of what he saw. Odd as it may seem, no one can remember exactly what he answered. Saucer historians have credited him with saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sighted the thing. It looks metallic and it&rsquo;s tremendous in size. . . . Now it&rsquo;s starting to climb.&rdquo; Then in a few seconds he is supposed to have called and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s above me and I&rsquo;m gaining on it. I&rsquo;m going to 20,000 feet.&rdquo; Everyone in the tower agreed on this one last bit of the transmission, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to 20,000 feet,&rdquo; but didn&rsquo;t agree on the first part, about the UFO&rsquo;s being metallic and tremendous.</p>
<p>The two wing men were now at 15,000 feet and trying frantically to call Mantell. He had climbed far above them by this time and was out of sight. Since none of them had any oxygen they were worried about Mantell. Their calls were not answered. Mantell never talked to anyone again. The two wing men leveled off at 15,000 feet, made another fruitless effort to call Mantell, and started to come back down. As they passed Godman Tower on their way to their base, one of them said something to the effect that all he had seen was a reflection on his canopy.</p>
<p>When they landed at their base, Standiford Field, just north of Godman, one pilot had his F-51 refueled and serviced with oxygen, and took off to search the area again. He didn&rsquo;t see anything.</p>
<p>At three-fifty the tower lost sight of the UFO. A few minutes later they got word that Mantell had crashed and was dead.</p>
<p>Several hours later, at 7:20P.M., airfield towers all over the Midwest sent in frantic reports of another UFO. In all about a dozen airfield towers reported the UFO as being low on the southwestern horizon and disappearing after about twenty minutes. The writers of saucer lore say this UFO was what Mantell was chasing when he died; the Air Force says this UFO was Venus.</p>
