                <p>The details of this project are still being revealed - however the following seems to be accurate.</p>
<p>In 2007 the DIA established the Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program (AAWSAP) to investigate so-called &lsquo;breakthrough technologies&rsquo; and develop an understanding of the threat they might pose to the United States of America.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/advanced-aerospace-weapon-systems-applications-program-aawsap-original-bid-solicitation/">The Black Vault</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;this contract was awarded to Bigelow Aerospaceâ€˜s subsidiary Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS). Ultimately, it was reported that $22 million went to BAASS over the course of two years, and as a result, they produced 38 Defense Intelligence Reference Documents (DIRD) reports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AAWSAP was informally referred to as AATIP - a designation that Harry Reid used when communicating about the project outside of classified contexts. According to <em>Skinwalkers at the Pentagon</em> this AATIP &lsquo;nickname&rsquo; was not the same as the AATIP that was established at the Pentagon and led by Luis Elizondo.</p>
<h2 id="according-to-elizondos-history-of-aatip-presentation">According to Elizondo&rsquo;s History of AATIP presentation</h2>
<p>2007 - Program originally created as a bipartisan effort (Stevens (R) [witnessed a UAP when he was a pilot? senator for Alaska], Inouye (D-Hawaii), and Reid (D-Nevada) to better understand UAPs encountered by U.S. military ad [sic] determine if they represent a national security threat. (History of AATIP)</p>
<p>2007 - Congressional language establishes the &ldquo;Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Application Program&rdquo;, aka AAWSAP (History of AATIP)</p>
<p>2007 - DIA solicits contracts and BAAS [sic] is awarded the contract (History of AATIP)</p>
