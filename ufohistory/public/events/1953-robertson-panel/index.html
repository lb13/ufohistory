        <h1>Robertson Panel</h1>

        <p><p>1953-January-14,15,16
Robertson Panel, Washington D.C.
CIA-sponsored meeting of a scientific panel to consider the problem of &ldquo;flying saucers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The outcome of these meetings was a classified recommendation to make up stories and plausible explanations for the phenomenon to keep the public unaware of extra terrestrials and reduce the number of UFO reports coming in.</p>
<p>It concluded that it should discount all reports from the public and rely on instrumentation from the military. The overseers of the panel kept Project Bluebook going, but not the Robertson Panel. They kept Project Bluebook so that the public would have a place to write if they saw something, but it was a very low level thing.</p>
