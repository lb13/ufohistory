      <description>The newly formed 4602nd Air Intelligence Squadron (AISS) of the Air Defense Command was assigned the task of investigating only the most important UFO cases with intelligence or national security implications. These cases were deliberately siphoned away from Blue Book, leaving Blue Book to deal with the more trivial reports.</description>

Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Bob Lazar. During late 1988 and early 1989, I worked on the propulsion systems of extraterrestrial vehicles for the United States government. The hardware and technology I was exposed to should be placed in the proper hands of the scientific community, and it is the right of every person on Earth to know that there is physical evidence which proves that there is life elsewhere, and that at least one form of that life has been here.</description>

      <description>The Condon Committee suggested that there was nothing extraordinary about UFOs, and while it left a minority of cases unexplained, the report also argued that further research would not be likely to yield significant results.

The Dulce base, allegedly, is the most profound military service, over 2.5 miles deep, with seven levels, with labs, door rooms, a railroad connection to Los Alamos and a spacecraftâ€™s entrance.
According to Philip Schneider, his team drilled four distinct holes in the desert with the intention to connect each other.</description>

He was looking down at the ground when suddenly he noticed a series of bright flashes off to his left.</description>

When it was directly overhead it made a sharp 90-degree turn and was lost from view as it traveled south.</description>

At 10:10A.M. a test pilot was running up the engine of the then new XP-84 in preparation for a test flight.</description>

      <description>In his book The Report on UFOs, Edward Ruppelt provides the following account:
 The week of July 4, 1947, set a record for reports that was not broken until 1952. The center of activity was the Portland, Oregon, area. At 11:00A.M. a carload of people driving near Redmond saw four disk-shaped objects streaking past Mount Jefferson. At 1:05P.M. a policeman was in the parking lot behind the Portland City Police Headquarters when he noticed some pigeons suddenly began to flutter around as if they were scared.</description>

      <description>Initially led by Captain Edward J. Ruppelt.
He commissioned the Battelle Memorial Institute to create the questionnaire and computerize the data. Using case reports and the computerized data, Battelle then conducted a massive scientific and statistical study of all Air Force UFO cases, completed in 1954 and known as &amp;ldquo;Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14&amp;rdquo;
Starting in late March 1952, the Institute started analyzing existing sighting reports and encoding about 30 report characteristics onto IBM punched cards for computer analysis.</description>

      <description>As an immediate consequence of the Robertson Panel recommendations, in February 1953, the Air Force issued Regulation 200-2, ordering air base officers to publicly discuss UFO incidents only if they were judged to have been solved, and to classify all the unsolved cases to keep them out of the public eye</description>

      <description>1953-January-14,15,16 Robertson Panel, Washington D.C. CIA-sponsored meeting of a scientific panel to consider the problem of &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo;.
The outcome of these meetings was a classified recommendation to make up stories and plausible explanations for the phenomenon to keep the public unaware of extra terrestrials and reduce the number of UFO reports coming in.
It concluded that it should discount all reports from the public and rely on instrumentation from the military.</description>

      <description>Recovered materials were sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and from there went to Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI) where they led to the development of memory materials using titanium alloys.
Tom Delonge believes that the craft was German/Argentinian.
Debris was analysed by Elroy John Center at BMI, said that the debris had been inscribed with strange symbols that he called &amp;ldquo;glyphics&amp;rdquo;.
