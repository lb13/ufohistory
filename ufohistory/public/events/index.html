In addition, the aliens could abduct humans and livestock on a limited basis for medical examination and monitoring - the people subjected to these experiences would not be harmed, and would be returned to their point of abduction with no recollection of the event. The US could also do a medical examination and genetic experience with aliens and would share the results; the aliens would be granted secret facilities for their accommodations and experiences.

        Alien Reproduction Vehicle (ARV) Displayed at Norton Air Force Base

        
        Mark McCandlish reports that his colleague Brad Sorenson visited an Air Force show at Norton Air Force Base in November 1988. In a separated area, he witnessed three so-called alien reproduction vehicles, which resembled UFOs in appearance - they appeared to be well-worn and not brand new. McCandlish theorised that the technology was based on charged electrical plates.
