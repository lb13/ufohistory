        <h1>Project Blue Book</h1>

        <p><p>Initially led by Captain Edward J. Ruppelt.</p>
<p>He commissioned the Battelle Memorial Institute to create the questionnaire and computerize the data. Using case reports and the computerized data, Battelle then conducted a massive scientific and statistical study of all Air Force UFO cases, completed in 1954 and known as &ldquo;Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14&rdquo;</p>
<p>Starting in late March 1952, the Institute started analyzing existing sighting reports and encoding about 30 report characteristics onto IBM punched cards for computer analysis.</p>
