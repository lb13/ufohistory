      <description>In his book The Report on UFOs, Edward Ruppelt provides the following account:
 That night at nine-twenty, four Air Force officers, two pilots, and two intelligence officers from Maxwell AFB in Montgomery, Alabama, saw a bright light traveling across the sky. It was first seen just above the horizon, and as it traveled toward the observers it &amp;ldquo;zigzagged,&amp;rdquo; with bursts of high speed. When it was directly overhead it made a sharp 90-degree turn and was lost from view as it traveled south.</description>
