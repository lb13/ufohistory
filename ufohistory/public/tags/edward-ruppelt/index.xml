      <description>Initially led by Captain Edward J. Ruppelt.
He commissioned the Battelle Memorial Institute to create the questionnaire and computerize the data. Using case reports and the computerized data, Battelle then conducted a massive scientific and statistical study of all Air Force UFO cases, completed in 1954 and known as &amp;ldquo;Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14&amp;rdquo;
Starting in late March 1952, the Institute started analyzing existing sighting reports and encoding about 30 report characteristics onto IBM punched cards for computer analysis.</description>
