      <description>As an immediate consequence of the Robertson Panel recommendations, in February 1953, the Air Force issued Regulation 200-2, ordering air base officers to publicly discuss UFO incidents only if they were judged to have been solved, and to classify all the unsolved cases to keep them out of the public eye

      <description>1953-January-14,15,16 Robertson Panel, Washington D.C. CIA-sponsored meeting of a scientific panel to consider the problem of &amp;ldquo;flying saucers&amp;rdquo;.
The outcome of these meetings was a classified recommendation to make up stories and plausible explanations for the phenomenon to keep the public unaware of extra terrestrials and reduce the number of UFO reports coming in.
It concluded that it should discount all reports from the public and rely on instrumentation from the military.</description>
