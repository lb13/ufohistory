      <description>In his book The Report on UFOs, Edward Ruppelt provides the following account:
 That night [4th July 1947] a United Airlines crew flying near Emmett, Idaho, saw five. The pilot&amp;rsquo;s report read:
 Five &amp;ldquo;somethings,&amp;rdquo; which were thin and smooth on the bottom and rough-appearing on top, were seen silhouetted against the sunset shortly after the plane took off from Boise at 8:04P.M. We saw them clearly. We followed them in a northeasterly direction for about 45 miles.</description>
