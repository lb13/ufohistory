The "Ghost Rockets" wave began with early reports in February 1946 (first in Finland on February 26) but peaked in summer, especially July–August, with ~2,000 total sightings logged (peaks of hundreds on August 9 and 11). Objects were described as elongated, rocket- or cigar-shaped (some with wings or flames), moving at high speeds, often silent, and sometimes crashing into lakes.

The Swedish military responded aggressively: radar tracked ~200 cases, aircraft were scrambled, crash sites were searched (notably Lake Kölmjärv on July 19, 1946, where witnesses saw a gray rocket-shaped object plunge in—military divers and searches found no wreckage after weeks). Fragments recovered were mostly meteoric. Initial suspicions pointed to Soviet tests of German V-2 derivatives, but no matching launches were confirmed, and the U.S. sent observers (including Gen. Jimmy Doolittle). Many cases were later attributed to meteors (e.g., Perseids), but a significant portion remained unexplained.

Often seen as the first major post-WWII UFO flap, predating the 1947 "flying saucer" wave and heightening global interest in aerial mysteries.
