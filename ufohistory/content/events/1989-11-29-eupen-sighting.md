The Eupen incident is often cited as the kickoff to the Belgian UFO Wave (November 1989–April 1990). Around 8:00 p.m., Gendarmes Heinrich Nicoll and Hubert Von Montemart observed a flat, triangular platform (~30–40 meters wide) with three bright headlights and a central red light, hovering silently before moving slowly. It emitted a low hum and downward beams that illuminated the ground. They followed it for ~45 minutes; other witnesses reported similar objects.

No official explanation; investigated by SOBEPS (Société Belge d'Étude des Phénomènes Spatiaux). This event triggered hundreds of subsequent reports over the next months.
