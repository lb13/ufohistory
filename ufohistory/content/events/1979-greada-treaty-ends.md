Title: Greada Treaty Ends
Description: According to Bob Lazar this exchange continued in central Nevada until 1979 '...at which time there was a conflict which brought the program to an abrupt halt', with an agreement that the Greys would return at some point in the future. The US government attempted to reverse engineer the remaining hardware using the information they had so-far obtained.
