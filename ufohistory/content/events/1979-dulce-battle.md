While involved in building an addition to the deep underground military facility at Dulce, New Mexico, an incident occurred quite by accident.

The Dulce base, allegedly, is the most profound military service, over 2.5 miles deep, with seven levels, with labs, door rooms, a railroad connection to Los Alamos and a spacecraft’s entrance.

According to Philip Schneider, his team drilled four distinct holes in the desert with the intention to connect each other.

Then he dropped to the end of the holes and analyzed rock samples, to them recommend the quantities and type of explosives.

At one of this drops, the group was surrounded by outer-space aliens, otherwise known as large Greys to an enormous cavern.

In Schneider’s own words:
“I shot two of them. At that time, there were 30 people down there. About 40 more came down after this started, and all of them got killed. We had surprised a whole underground base of existing aliens. Later, we found out that they had been living on our planet for a long time, perhaps a million years. This could explain a lot of what is behind the theory of ancient astronauts.”

During the bout, a tall Grey made a kind of movement with his “hand” on his chest (as if he made waves over his chest) and a blue ray struck Philip’s rib cage, knocking him to the ground.

Besides his chest, the lighting cut off and burned several fingers and nails of his hand and foot.

Sixty-six humans lost their lives in this battle, only Philip and other two men managed to escape.

For over a year Philip received treatment in a radiation isolation therapy.
