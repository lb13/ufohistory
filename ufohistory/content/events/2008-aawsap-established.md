The details of this project are still being revealed - however the following seems to be accurate.

In 2007 the DIA established the Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program (AAWSAP) to investigate so-called 'breakthrough technologies' and develop an understanding of the threat they might pose to the United States of America.

According to [The Black Vault](https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/advanced-aerospace-weapon-systems-applications-program-aawsap-original-bid-solicitation/):

>...this contract was awarded to Bigelow Aerospaceâ€˜s subsidiary Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS). Ultimately, it was reported that $22 million went to BAASS over the course of two years, and as a result, they produced 38 Defense Intelligence Reference Documents (DIRD) reports.

AAWSAP was informally referred to as AATIP - a designation that Harry Reid used when communicating about the project outside of classified contexts. According to *Skinwalkers at the Pentagon* this AATIP 'nickname' was not the same as the AATIP that was established at the Pentagon and led by Luis Elizondo.

## According to Elizondo's History of AATIP presentation
2007 - Program originally created as a bipartisan effort (Stevens (R) [witnessed a UAP when he was a pilot? senator for Alaska], Inouye (D-Hawaii), and Reid (D-Nevada) to better understand UAPs encountered by U.S. military ad [sic] determine if they represent a national security threat. (History of AATIP)

2007 - Congressional language establishes the "Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Application Program", aka AAWSAP (History of AATIP)

2007 - DIA solicits contracts and BAAS [sic] is awarded the contract (History of AATIP)
