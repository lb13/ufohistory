Over two nights near RAF Woodbridge (Suffolk, England), USAF security personnel observed unexplained lights. On December 26 (~3:00 a.m.), Sgt. Jim Penniston and John Burroughs approached what they described as a small triangular metallic craft (approx. 9 ft across) with glowing lights and hieroglyph-like symbols; Penniston claimed he touched it and later received a telepathic binary code. The object lifted off and departed.

On December 28, Lt. Col. Charles Halt led a team back to the site, recorded audio of observations (the famous "Halt Tape"), noted elevated radiation, and saw flashing red/white lights maneuvering through trees and beaming down. Physical traces included depressions in the ground.

Halt's official memo to the UK Ministry of Defence described the events. Skeptics suggest lighthouse beams (Orford Ness), a meteor, or misidentified lights, but witnesses (including Halt in later affidavits) maintain it was extraterrestrial. No radar confirmation was publicly released.

Often called the best-documented UFO incident involving military personnel outside the U.S.
