Title: Greada Treaty Signed
Description: President Eisenhower allegedly meets with extraterrestrials at Holloman Airforce Base and signs a treaty with Grey aliens that states the aliens would not interfere in human affairs, and humans would not interfere in theirs; the US Government would keep their presence on earth secret while the aliens would furnish the US with advanced technology. In addition, the aliens could abduct humans and livestock on a limited basis for medical examination and monitoring - the people subjected to these experiences would not be harmed, and would be returned to their point of abduction with no recollection of the event. The US could also do a medical examination and genetic experience with aliens and would share the results; the aliens would be granted secret facilities for their accommodations and experiences. According to Bob Lazar this exchange continued in central Nevada until 1979 '...at which time there was a conflict which brought the program to an abrupt halt'.
