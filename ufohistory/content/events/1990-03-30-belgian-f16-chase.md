A major escalation in the Belgian UFO Wave, with ~13,500 witnesses overall but this night standing out due to military involvement. From ~11:00 p.m. March 30 into early March 31, ground observers (including police) reported silent triangular crafts with lights. At Glons radar station, unidentified targets were tracked; two F-16s from Beauvechain Air Base were launched.

Pilots achieved three radar locks (confirmed by onboard and ground radar), but the objects accelerated from ~150 mph to over 1,100 mph in seconds, changed altitude drastically (e.g., from 9,000 ft to 500 ft), and evaded. No sonic booms or damage. Belgian Air Force Chief of Staff Col. Wilfried De Brouwer held a press conference, releasing data and ruling out conventional explanations like aircraft or balloons.

This event effectively marked the peak and near-end of the wave, with sightings tapering off by April 1990. Investigated by SOBEPS and the military; no conclusive identification.
