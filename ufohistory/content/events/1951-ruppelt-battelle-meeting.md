The text below comes from the Project Stork notes (http://www.cufon.org/cufon/stork1-7.htm):

> Lt. E. J. Ruppelt and Col. Kirkland conferred with members of [                                ] on 26 December 1951 in regard to Project Grudge.  The question of whether or not there was enough material available on unidentified aerial objects to warrant a detailed scientific study was discussed.  It was decided that there was enough material available and [              ] would submit a proposal to furnish consultants in the fields of astronomy, applied psychology, physics, etc.  They will also attempt to make a statistical analysis of the reports in an attempt to obtain some pattern or trend.  It is very reasonable to believe that some type of unusual object or phenomena is being observed as many of the sightings have been made by highly qualified sources.
