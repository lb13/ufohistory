On the evening of January 23, 1974, around 8:30 p.m., residents in Llandrillo and surrounding villages near the Berwyn Mountains (North Wales) heard a massive explosion/shockwave (shaking houses, like a landslide or detonation) and saw a brilliant light/fireball descending toward Cadair Berwyn peak, sometimes described as glowing red/orange or trailing fire/smoke.

Police received numerous calls (initially fearing a plane crash); search parties including local officers, RAF/military personnel, and volunteers combed the hills but found no wreckage, impact crater, fire, or debris. Some later witnesses claimed to see military vehicles, cordons, or "digging" activity, fueling theories of a crashed UFO/saucer retrieved secretly (dubbed "Welsh Roswell" or "Roswelsh" by tabloids and ufologists).

Official investigations (MoD, British Geological Survey, astronomers) concluded it was a coincidence: a minor earthquake (~4.0–4.5 magnitude, centered under the mountains at 8:32 p.m.) caused the bang/tremor, while a bright meteor/bolide (widely observed across Wales/northern England) created the descending light illusion (likely disintegrating high up). No UFO evidence was found in declassified files (released 2010).

The case remains divisive—believers cite alleged inconsistencies and secrecy; skeptics see it as classic natural-phenomena misperception amplified by Cold War-era paranoia.
