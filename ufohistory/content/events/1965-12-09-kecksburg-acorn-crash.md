On the evening of December 9, 1965, a brilliant fireball was sighted across six U.S. states and Ontario, Canada, streaking low and appearing to crash in the woods near Kecksburg, Pennsylvania (Westmoreland County, ~30 miles southeast of Pittsburgh).

Local residents, including firefighters and police, rushed to the site and reported finding a bronze-colored, acorn- or bell-shaped metallic object (~10–15 ft long, roughly Volkswagen Beetle-sized) partially embedded in the ground. Witnesses described no visible seams, rivets, or propulsion; some noted strange hieroglyph-like markings on a band around it. U.S. military personnel (Army/Air Force) and state police arrived quickly, cordoned off the area with armed guards, restricted access, and reportedly removed the object that night on a flatbed truck under tarps (multiple witnesses saw it hauled away).

Official searches found no debris; initial explanations cited a meteor bolide. NASA later stated (2005) that fragments examined were from a Soviet satellite (possibly Kosmos 96, which re-entered that day), but relevant records were "lost" in 1987. A 2003–2007 FOIA lawsuit forced NASA to search archives again; some documents were released (no conclusive ET evidence), but skeptics claim ongoing withholding. Alternative theories include a classified U.S. re-entry vehicle or meteor.

Often called "Pennsylvania's Roswell" for the alleged crash-retrieval and secrecy. The incident inspired an annual Kecksburg UFO Festival and replicas of the "acorn" object.
