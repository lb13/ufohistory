Recovered materials were sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and from there went to Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI) where they led to the development of memory materials using titanium alloys.

Tom Delonge believes that the craft was German/Argentinian.

Debris was analysed by Elroy John Center at BMI, said that the debris had been inscribed with strange symbols that he called "glyphics".
