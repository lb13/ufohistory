<p>Incident #53 -- near Lake Meade, Nevada -- 28 June, 1947</p>

<p>There appears to be nothing astronomical about this incident. According to the observer, the objects had a speed of 285 MPH and were moving on a course of 120&deg;. Now, since the plane was moving at 285 MPH on a course of 300&deg;, it is possible that the observed motion of the objects was only apparent (since 180&deg; plus 120&deg; equal 300&deg;), and we can conjecture that a cluster of balloons (cosmic ray apparatus perhaps) was observed, the motion of which was merely a reflection of the motion of the plane.</p>

MEMORANDUM FOR THE OFFICER IN CHARGE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. On 14 July 1947, 1st Lt Eric B. Armstrong, O-2059709, 170th AAF Base Unit, Ferry Division, Brooks Field, San Antonio, Texas was interviewed and the following information obtained: Lt. Armstrong departed Williams Field, Arizona at [unclear, possibly 1400] CST on 28 June 1947 in a P-51 for Portland, Oregon, by the way of Medford, Oregon. At approximately 1515 CST on a course of 300 degrees, and ground speed of 285, altitude 10,000 feet, approximately thirty miles northwest of Lake Meade, Nevada Lt. Armstrong sighted five or six white, circular objects at four o'clock, altitude approximately 6,000 feet, courses approximately 120 degrees and an estimated speed of 285 MPH. Lt. Armstrong said the objects were flying very smoothly and in a close formation. The estimated size of the white objects were approximately 36 inches in diameter. Lt. Armstrong stated that he is sure the white objects were not birds, since the rate of closure was very fast. Lt. Armstrong was certain that the white objects were not jets or conventional type aircraft since he has flown both types.

AGENT'S NOTES:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lt. Armstrong was very sincere in the explanation and was not the exaggerating type. He merely stated that he saw and has drawn no conclusions as to what the white objects were.
