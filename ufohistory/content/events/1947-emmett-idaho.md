In his book *[The Report on UFOs](/sources/report-on-ufos-ruppelt)*, Edward Ruppelt provides the following account:

>That night [4th July 1947] a United Airlines crew flying near Emmett, Idaho, saw five. The pilot's report read:
>
>>Five "somethings," which were thin and smooth on the bottom and rough-appearing on top, were seen silhouetted against the sunset shortly after the plane took off from Boise at 8:04P.M. We saw them clearly. We followed them in a northeasterly direction for about 45 miles. They finally disappeared. We were unable to tell whether they outsped us or disintegrated. We can't say whether they were "smearlike," oval, or anything else but whatever they were they were not aircraft, clouds or smoke.
