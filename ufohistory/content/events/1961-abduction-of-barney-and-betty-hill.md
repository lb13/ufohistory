The Barney and Betty Hill incident is considered the first widely publicized alien abduction case in modern UFO history. While driving home from a vacation through Franconia Notch, New Hampshire, around 10:30 p.m. on September 19, 1961, the couple observed a bright light that grew into an odd-shaped craft with flashing lights. Barney stopped the car and approached with binoculars, claiming to see humanoid figures in glossy black uniforms staring at him. Fearing capture, he fled back to the car; they heard beeping sounds, experienced a daze, and arrived home seven hours later than expected with fragmented memories ("missing time").

Disturbed by odd sensations (e.g., stopped watches, torn clothing, shiny spots on their car trunk), they reported the sighting to NICAP and the U.S. Air Force. Betty had vivid dreams of being taken aboard the craft by grey-skinned beings, and under hypnosis sessions with psychiatrist Dr. Benjamin Simon starting in 1964, both recalled being abducted, separated, and subjected to medical examinations (e.g., probes, skin samples). Betty described a conversation in English with a "leader" and drew a "star map" shown to her, which amateur astronomer Marjorie Fish later interpreted (1968–1974) as matching the Zeta Reticuli star system from Earth's viewpoint.

The story gained fame through John G. Fuller's 1966 book *The Interrupted Journey* and the 1975 TV movie *The UFO Incident*. Skeptics suggest misidentification of an aircraft beacon on Cannon Mountain, sleep deprivation, and cultural influences (e.g., *The Outer Limits* episodes featuring wraparound-eyed aliens aired shortly before Barney's hypnosis). Analyses of Betty's dress (pinkish powder) and the star map have been debated; Fish later rejected her own hypothesis based on updated stellar data from Hipparcos.

Barney died in 1969; Betty in 2004. The case remains iconic, with a New Hampshire historical marker at the site and items archived at the University of New Hampshire.
